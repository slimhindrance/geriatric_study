Objectives: The objective of this study is to address the barriers that U.S. Medicare patients face to have access to healthcare services in Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), including quality geriatric care, for patients in their local community. Methods:  We used data collected through anonymous internal and external surveys of pre-Medicare and Medicare-eligible adults ages 50 and older. Internal surveys were distributed to every patient upon check-in at the CHN Lower East Side and Washington Heights sites in New York City. Result: (Chris)

### BACKGROUND

Access to healthcare services for Medicare patients remains a public health issue and little is known for beneficiaries who use FQHCs (Chang, 2016). In 1989, Congress established the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) program with the objective of supporting community health centers with primary care services delivery in low-income areas (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, 2018). FQHCs are based on the FQHC Prospective Payment System (PPS) for medically-necessary primary health services and qualified preventive health services furnished by an FQHC professional (CMCS, 2018). By 2011, the number of FQHCs exceeded 5000 in the United States (Chang, 2016); the number of Medicare beneficiaries seen at FQHCs experienced a dramatic increase between 2001 to 2011 (from 745,000 to nearly 1.6 million) (Russel, 2019) . Older adults from low socioeconomic status (SES) often have higher difficulty tapping into much needed, life-sustaining health care. (Bennet et al. 2009; Ponce, 2006). According to the State of Aging and Health in America (SOA, 2013), the aging population of Americans aged sixty-five years or older will double during the next 25 years to about 72 million. Moreover, by 2030, older adults will account for roughly twenty percent of the U.S. population (SOA, 2013). Thus, it is important to link Medicare patients to services provided by FQHCs not only to insure that they are receiving proper treatment or referral to specialty care, but also FQHCs depend on Medicare patients for their operation and sustainability (CMS, 2013, Chang, 2016). Due to the mandated comprehensive care Medicare beneficiaries receive during their visits, FQHCs are capable of detecting and preventing health problems early because they offer a unique opportunity for patients to receive comprehensive, coordinated care in their communities (Leos, 2012). Functioning as a “one-stop shop” for health care needs, FQHCs may potentially be an ideal place for older adults to receive quality geriatric care. Although there has been a number of studies focusing on populations under age 65 ( Falik et al., 2001, McClaskey EL., 2010, Bhatia P, 2013), there is little research on the topic. There is no study of older adults who rely on FQHC services from a population-based perspective (Chang, 2016). Medicare patients suffering from multiple chronic diseases, unable to access FQHCs in their communities, or seek specialty care are some examples of public health issues older adults may face over the years. Research has shown that many Americans who survive to age 65 can expect to need and use long-term services and supports (LTSS) with an average cost of $138,000 in future LTSS costs ( HHS, 2016). Therefore, the purpose of this article is to address the barriers that Medicare patients face to have access to healthcare services in their community. Since it is crucial to understand characteristics and service use of Medicare beneficiaries who use FQHCs, this article will make recommendations for federally qualified health centers to consider when proposing, implementing, or designing geriatric care programs.
